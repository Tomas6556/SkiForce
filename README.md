# SkiForce Mid-Fidelity Prototype

SkiForce was developed as a University project for one of my courses. The aim was to create a mid-fidelity prototype which would build upon five dimensions of interaction design, employing clear wording, visual representations, and perceptible feedback. Through animations and intuitive behaviors, SkiForce attempts to build a delightful and adaptable user experience. The prototype attempts to integrate affordances, mental models, and satisfaction parameters, prioritising user-centricity and enbodying Human-Computer Interaction principles.
